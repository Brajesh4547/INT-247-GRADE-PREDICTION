# INT-247-PROJECT-ML-
The project basically deals with how to predict the Grade of student based upon their performances using Different Clssification Techniques.In this project we have used so many different classification technique to get the best optimized result.
The classification Technique are given as follows:
(1)SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
(2)LOGISTIC REGRESSION.
(3)RANDOM FOREST.
(4)DECISION TREE.
(5)KNN ALGO
(6)NAIVE BAYES ALGO.
 
#STEPS TO MAKE THIS PROJECT:
(1)EXtracted our dataset from main result dataset as we have to only take those dataset in which studennts are from Bachelor of Science(Hons)Chemistry.
(2).Apply preprocessing on data like finding the missing values,null values etc.
(3)Apply some function on dataset like drop method to drop those column which have more null values which will affect our accuracy of the model.
(4).After performing all these things we will divide the data into two parts x and y ,x is for training and y is for testing.
(5).Here we will apply different classification technique to train and test our model and then predict the accuracy.
(6).Here accuracy basically denotes the average percentage of students ,so we will compare it with Standard scalar of grading and print grading according to that percentage.
